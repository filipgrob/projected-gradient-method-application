# projected-gradient-method-application
This code was developed as an assignment for the Numerical Optimization and Stochastic Optimization course. The main task is to apply the projected gradient method to the steepest descent to find the minimum of a general function. The problem can be viewed as a constrained optimization problem in a feasible set through different types of projections. A more detailed presentation of the project is reported inside C_Assignment_1_Grobbo_Civiero.pdf file.
